Requires: Python 2, Wand (pip install Wand), ImageMagick (http://www.imagemagick.org/)

Usage: textoverlay.py filename "top text" "bottom text"

Known issues: The text gets really small if you have more than a few words, which is an issue. Please tell me if you know a solution for this? (word wrap, whatever)
